The interview consisted of 3 rounds: 1) Online coding test with 3 DSA questions - one was related to linked list manipulation, another was about finding palindromes, and the third was a dynamic programming problem. 2) Technical interview where they asked about JavaScript closures, event loop, and how to optimize database queries. They also asked me to explain my previous project architecture. 3) HR round discussing salary expectations, notice period, and why I want to join Darwinbox.",
